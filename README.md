Sales Trend Analysis â€“ SQLite
For this task, I created an SQL script to analyze monthly sales trends. The script creates the online_sales table, inserts 20 sample records, and uses SQLite date functions to group the data by year and month. It then calculates the total revenue and order volume for each month.

I have included both the SQL script and the results table as the deliverables for this task
